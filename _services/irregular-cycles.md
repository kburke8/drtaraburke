An irregular menstrual cycle is one in which the length of time between periods varies by more than 8 days. A long menstrual cycle is one in which the period lasts longer than 7 days, and an absent menstrual cycle is one in which no period occurs. These issues can be caused by a variety of factors, and understanding the underlying cause is important in order to determine the appropriate treatment.

## Common causes of irregular and/or long and/or absent cycles include:

* **Hormonal imbalances:** Hormonal imbalances, such as those caused by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or thyroid disorders, can disrupt the regularity and length of menstrual cycles.
* **Stress:** Stress can affect the production of hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle, leading to irregular or absent periods.
* **Extreme weight loss or gain:** Significant changes in weight can disrupt the balance of hormones in the body and can lead to irregular or absent periods.
* **Nutrition:** Malnutrition occurs when a person does not consume enough nutrients to support their body's needs, while malabsorption refers to a problem with the body's ability to absorb the nutrients from the food that is consumed. Both malnutrition and malabsorption can lead to disruptions in normal hormonal balance that is necessary for regular menstrual cycles.
* **Certain medications:** Certain medications, such as birth control pills, can affect the regularity and length of menstrual cycles.
* **Age:** The menstrual cycle can become irregular as women approach menopause.
* **Pregnancy:** If a woman is pregnant, she will not have a menstrual period.

It is important to note that many women will have some variation in their menstrual cycles throughout their lives, and some women may have naturally regularly irregular cycles. However, if the cycles become prolonged or are consistently irregular, it's best to consult a healthcare professional. They will perform necessary tests to identify the cause and recommend appropriate treatment options, which may include medication, supplemental intervention, hormone therapy, or nutritional/lifestyle changes.

## Symptoms

* **Irregular periods:** This includes cycles that are shorter or longer than usual, or periods that are unpredictable in timing.
* **Heavy bleeding:** Longer cycles are often accompanied by heavy bleeding.
* **Painful Cycles:** When cramping or pain is severe enough to interfere with a person's daily activities or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as nausea or vomiting.
* **No menstruation:** If a woman is not menstruating at all, it could be an indication of a hormonal imbalance or other underlying condition.
* Other symptoms such as acne, headaches, bloating, mood swings, and fatigue can also be associated with irregular cycles.

## How is the root cause determined?

There are several ways to test and diagnose irregular menstrual cycles. A good foundation is laid by asking questions about the patient's medical history, current history, including any medications they may be taking or recent changes. They may also perform several other tests such as:

* **Labwork:** Blood tests can be used to measure levels of hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which play a role in regulating the menstrual cycle. Blood tests can also be used to check for the presence of other conditions such as thyroid disorders or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

* **Imaging tests:** Imaging tests such as ultrasound or MRI can be used to visualize the uterus, ovaries, and other structures in the pelvic area. These tests can help to identify any structural abnormalities or growths that may be impacting the menstrual cycle.

## How are hormones imbalances treated?

Once the cause of irregular menstrual cycles has been identified, treatment options will depend on the underlying condition. Some common treatment options include:

* **Oral contraceptive pills, spironolactone, surgery, etc.:** For many women conventional treatment is adequate but side effects from the pill (weight gain, mood changes, or breast tenderness) or from other medications can be undesirable or unmanageable. For others, they do not wish to take medications or the medications are not working as anticipated. Lastly, for women trying to get pregnant the pill is not an option.

* **Supplemental/ Herbal Interventions**

* **Lifestyle/Nutrition**
