At your first appointment Dr. Burke will take a thorough clinical and family history to get a picture of your health concerns and goals. She will also perform indicated Physical Exams to aid in diagnosis and treatment. Finally, she will order indicated comprehensive lab work to assess your hormone health. In addition to female hormone specific labs, lab work that measures other related body systems such as your liver and metabolic function will be completed. In this way Dr. Burke is able to better address the root cause of your hormone related symptoms and/ or conditions. Dr. Burke’s initial appointments are one hour in length in order to provide ample time evaluation of your hormone concerns and to answer all questions. 

After receiving all relevant information, Dr. Burke will provide a comprehensive individualized treatment plan that includes dietary and lifestyle counselling, supplemental/ herbal support, and if appropriate discussion of pharmaceutical options. Dr. Burke uses optimal lab ranges, looking beyond conventional reference ranges, and takes into context the values in relation to each other to best interpret your labs.

## Common Questions:

##### How do I know if my hormones are imbalanced?

Hormone imbalances can manifest in many ways. There are a variety of signs and symptoms hormonal in nature and is highly dependent on why and how your hormones are imbalanced. 

Common Types can include (please note this is not an all-inclusive list of types and signs)

* Estrogen Dominance – Estrogen levels are too high relative to progesterone levels. This can happen in a few ways:
  * Elevated estrogen levels
  * Depressed progesterone levels
  * Combination of an increase in estrogen and a decrease in progesterone
  * Symptoms of estrogen dominance include: Tender breasts, irregular cycles – long or short, bloating, acne, breast cysts, PMS, headaches, anxiety, weight gain, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, hair loss, and difficulties getting pregnant. 
* Low Estrogen – this is very characteristic for peri and post-menopausal women. 
    * Signs and symptoms include hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, joint and muscle pain, brain fog, bone loss, and low sex drive.
* Elevated Progesterone – While not as common as estrogen dominance, this hormonal imbalance is still possible. 
    * Symptoms of progesterone dominance are very sensitive to the cause but can include, bloating, sleepiness and grogginess, and mood changes.
* Elevated Testosterone – This is commonly seen in disorders like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), hirsutism, and in inappropriate dosed hormone replacement therapy.
    * Signs of Elevated Testosterone include acne, unwanted/inappropriate hair growth on places such as your chin, irregular periods, and feeling “more aggressive/irritated”.
* Low Testosterone – Low Testosterone is also seen commonly in the peri and post-menopause stages and is unfortunately a common part of ageing. 
     *  Signs of Low Testosterone include low libido, fatigue, weakness, and depressed mood.
* Other Hormone Imbalances – Thyroid and Adrenal health can be impacted by changes in female hormone health. Conversely, female hormone health can be impacted by disorders of thyroid and adrenal glands.
