Polycyctic Ovary Syndrome, often abbreviated PCOS, is a hormonal disorder commonly diagnosed in young women. It was named for multiple cysts seen on the ovaries of patients diagnosed with PCOS, although this is a bit of a misnomer as many patients with PCOS will not always have cystic ovaries.

When we think of the female hormonal system, we often associate it with estrogen and progesterone. Females also produce small amounts of androgens, like testosterone. These androgens are greatly elevated in PCOS which often leads to unusual hair growth, acne, and decreased fertility. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. Patients diagnosed with PCOS are more likely to be insulin resistant leading to elevations in blood sugar. Progesterone is a female hormone that is often decreased in PCOS, this can affect your menstrual cycle, leading to irregular or missed periods and decreased fertility. LH and FSH are also hormones involved in a women’s menstrual cycle

## Symptoms of PCOS 

* Irregular periods or absence of your period
* Unusual or unwanted hair growth, for example hair growth on the chin or head hair loss
* Acne
* High blood sugar/ elevated insulin levels
* Weight gain or the inability to lose weight
* Inability to get pregnant
* Fatigue

## How is PCOS diagnosed?

Currently, the most widely accepted way is by using something called the Rotterdam criteria:

Two of three are needed to make the diagnosis:

* Oligo – and/or anovulation – which means irregular cycles, or you are not ovulating.
* Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism – which means signs of high testosterone like acne or unwanted hair growth (like on the chin) OR high androgen on your labs work.
* Polycystic ovaries (by ultrasound) – exactly like it sounds, cysts are seen on your ovaries when imaging is performed.

## How is PCOS Treated?

Conventionally PCOS is treated with The Pill, which is a hormonal contraceptive. This regulates your cycle and decreases androgens. Additional medication, such as metformin and spironolactone, may be used for insulin resistance and for symptoms of high androgens such as acne and unwanted hair growth.

For many women conventional treatment is adequate but side effects from the pill (weight gain, mood changes, or breast tenderness) or from other medications can be undesirable or unmanageable. For others, they do not wish to take medications or the medications are not working as anticipated. Lastly, for women trying to get pregnant the pill is not an option.
