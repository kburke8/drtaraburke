Dr. Burke is passionate about helping women of all ages feel their very best! Whether you are struggling with an irregular cycle, fertility, acne, painful periods, eczema, digestive health, or perimenopausal symptoms, Naturopathic care can be a great option for you!

At your initial one-hour appointment, Dr. Burke will go through your current concerns, medical, family, and social history. She will also perform any indicated physical exams and provide ample time for questions. At the end of your visit she will provide any indicated treatment options and will order specific comprehensive lab work for your health concerns and goals. After your lab work is received, Dr. Burke will interpret your labs using optimal reference ranges and the context of the values in relation to each other, prior to your next appointment. 

At your thirty-minute follow-up appointment Dr. Burke will provide a comprehensive individualized treatment plan – including dietary and lifestyle recommendations, supplemental/ herbal support, and, if appropriate, will discuss pharmaceutical options. Dr. Burke tries to not only provide a treatment plan but also tries to identify the root cause of your health concerns. For example, if your cholesterol is elevated she will not look at it singularly but will identify why there is an elevation – perhaps it is due to a thyroid condition, diet, or lifestyle. 

After your initial and first follow-up appointment, Dr. Burke may recommend regular lab testing and check ins to provide safe, individualized, and effective care!

## Common Questions:

##### Can we discuss birth control options?

Yes! Dr. Burke can provide information to help you make an informed choice about your reproductive health.

##### How often do I need to follow-up?

This is very dependent on the individual, health factors and diagnosis, medication, and other additional health concerns you may have. In general, once symptoms have stabilized follow ups will be at minimum every six months to one year, or more frequently as desired. 

##### Do you provide Well Women’s exams?

At this time Dr. Burke will refer out for Well Women’s exams (routine gynecologic care such as PAP and breast exams). But she would love to be adjunctive in your care. 

##### What Lab options do you have?

Depending on your health concerns, Dr. Burke will recommend Serum (Blood), Salivary, and/or Urine Testing. Dr. Burke can discuss various insurance and cash-pay lab options to best fit your needs.
