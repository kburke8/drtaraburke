<p>Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is a medical treatment that involves supplementing or replacing hormones in the body, typically estrogen and progesterone in women, to alleviate symptoms related to hormonal imbalances. These imbalances often arise during menopause, a natural biological process that marks the end of a woman’s reproductive years. When Hormone Replacement Therapy is prescribed during menopause, the term Menopause Replacement Therapy (MRT) is utilized. MRT can be highly effective in managing menopausal symptoms, it’s crucial to determine if it is the right choice for you based on your medical history and individual circumstances.</p>

<p>MRT can provide relief from symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, mood swings, and sleep disturbances. MRT has been linked to the preservation of bone density, reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. For some women, MRT can also contribute to maintaining healthy skin elasticity and moisture, counteracting the skin changes often associated with declining estrogen levels. Moreover, MRT might positively impact mood stability and cognitive function, supporting emotional well-being and mental clarity. However, its suitability must be evaluated carefully, taking into consideration potential risks and contraindications. Medical professionals assess a patient’s medical history and risk factors before recommending MRT. Here are some factors to consider when deciding if MRT is right for you:</p>

<p>If you fall into the following categories, you may be considered a low-risk candidate for Menopause Replacement Therapy (MRT), with potential benefits outweighing potential risks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Age Under 60:</strong> Being under the age of 60 is generally associated with a more favorable response to HRT, as the risks are often considered lower within this age range.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Recent Menopause:</strong> If you are within 10 years of entering menopause, your body might still respond well to hormone supplementation, providing effective relief from menopausal symptoms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Normal Weight:</strong> Maintaining a healthy weight is advantageous when considering HRT, as it contributes to overall cardiovascular health and may lower the risks associated with hormone therapy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Normal Blood Pressure:</strong> Having normal blood pressure levels enhances your candidacy for HRT, as it reduces the likelihood of complications related to blood pressure fluctuations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Active Lifestyle:</strong> An active lifestyle can positively impact the effectiveness of HRT and reduce certain health risks. Regular physical activity supports cardiovascular health and may contribute to a smoother experience with hormone therapy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Routine wellness exams:</strong> These exams which including Pap smears and mammograms, play a crucial role in maintaining your overall health during menopause and beyond. Pap smears, also known as Pap tests, are essential for detecting abnormal cervical cells that could potentially develop into cervical cancer. Mammograms are an effective tool for detecting early signs of breast cancer. These routine screenings should be integrated into your healthcare plan to ensure any potential health issues are identified and addressed promptly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While these factors suggest that you may be a good candidate for HRT, it’s important to remember that each individual’s medical history and circumstances are unique. Consulting with a healthcare professional is essential to determine the best course of action tailored to your specific health profile and needs.</p>

<p>Certain medical conditions and situations may indicate that MRT should be used under caution with careful monitoring. It’s important to make your provider aware of any of these and have an open discussion with them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hypertriglyceridemia:</strong> Exercise caution, especially with oral administration, as it could impact lipid levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Active Gallbladder Disease:</strong> Risk may be minimized by using transdermal estradiol, but careful consideration is still needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Increased Risk of Breast Cancer:</strong> Evaluate and weigh potential risks and benefits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Disease:</strong> Assess risk before proceeding with HRT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Migraine with Aura:</strong> Consider transdermal estradiol as a potential option to mitigate risks associated with migraine with aura.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Diabetes:</strong> Caution is advised, as HRT might affect blood glucose levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Smoking:</strong> Smoking can increase risks associated with HRT, warranting careful evaluation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Obesity / Sedentary Lifestyle / Limited Mobility:</strong> These factors can influence the decision to use HRT due to potential increased risks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Certain medical conditions and situations may indicate that MRT is not suitable for an individual. It’s important to be aware of these contraindications and have an open discussion with your healthcare provider if any apply to you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A Previous Blood Clot or Stroke:</strong> Individuals with a history of blood clots or strokes are often advised against MRT, as it could potentially increase the risk of these conditions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Coronary Heart Disease or Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack):</strong> Those with a history of coronary heart disease or a heart attack are generally not recommended to undergo MRT, as it may pose risks to cardiovascular health.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Untreated High Blood Pressure:</strong> MRT can lead to fluctuations in blood pressure, making it unsuitable for individuals with untreated high blood pressure. Once blood pressure is treated MRT can be considered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Current or Past History of Breast Cancer:</strong> MRT may not be recommended for individuals with a current or past history of breast cancer due to concerns about estrogen’s potential influence on cancer growth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Current or Past History of Endometrial Cancer:</strong> Individuals with a history of endometrial cancer are typically advised against MRT, as it involves estrogen supplementation that could impact cancer recurrence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Severe Active Liver Disease:</strong> MRT can affect liver function, and individuals with severe active liver disease might not be suitable candidates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Unexplained Vaginal Bleeding:</strong> Until the cause of vaginal bleeding is identified and treated post menopause, initiating MRT might not be advisable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Known Clotting Disorder or Thrombophilia:</strong> People with clotting disorders or thrombophilia, conditions that increase the risk of blood clots, might be at an increased risk of complications with MRT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Family History of Breast or Endometrial Cancer:</strong> A very strong family history of these cancers could influence the decision to undergo MRT, it is not always a contraindication but weighs heavily into risks vs. benefits of therapy.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important to emphasize that individual medical circumstances can vary widely, and the decision to pursue MRT should be made in consultation with a qualified healthcare provider. They will assess your medical history, discuss your specific risk factors,</p>

<p>and help you make an informed decision about whether MRT is appropriate for you.</p>

<p>In cases where MRT is contraindicated, there are alternative treatments and lifestyle changes that can help manage menopausal symptoms. These may include non-hormonal medications, dietary adjustments, regular exercise, stress reduction techniques, and complementary therapies.</p>

<p>The decision of whether Hormone/Menopause Replacement Therapy is right for you depends on a thorough evaluation of your medical history, risk factors, and the presence of any contraindicating conditions. While MRT can be effective in alleviating menopausal symptoms, it’s essential to prioritize your overall health and well-being. Open and informed discussions with your healthcare provider will empower you to make the best decision for your unique situation, ensuring that your chosen treatment plan aligns with your health goals and needs.</p>]]></content><author><name>Dr. Tara Burke</name></author><category term="Naturopathic Medicine" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is a medical treatment that involves supplementing or replacing hormones in the body, typically estrogen and progesterone in women...]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Long Cycle</title><link href="https://drtaraburke.com/the-long-cycle/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Long Cycle" /><published>2020-04-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-04-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://drtaraburke.com/the-long-cycle</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://drtaraburke.com/the-long-cycle/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-long-cycle">The Long Cycle</h1>

<p>Have you ever wondered why your cycle isn’t regular or why it is longer than “normal”? This article explores possible reasons why your cycle is long and how to find the root cause as to why.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cycle-length">Cycle Length</h2>

<p>First, it is important to define what a long cycle means to you. Is it regular every 2 months? Is it not the “normal” 28 days but instead every 35 days? Or is it totally unpredictable, coming every 2- 6 months? There are a few categories listed below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Not Cycling/ No Period (Amenorrhea)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>No period ever in lifetime</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Previously cycling but period has stopped</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cycling:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Regularly Irregular (ex. cycle every 3 months- predictable)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Irregular Cycle – (ex. cycle is every 2 months or 1 month – you cannot predict when your period will arrive)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Irregular Long (ex. cycle is every 6 months, 3 months – you cannot predict when your period would arrive)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="medical-definitions-of-a-long-cycle">Medical Definitions of a Long Cycle:</h2>

<p><strong>Oligomenorrhea</strong>, “a long cycle”, is defined as fewer than nine menstrual cycles per year AND/OR a cycle length greater than 35 days.</p>

<p><strong>Amenorrhea</strong>, not having a period, is defined as no period for 3 months if you used to have regular cycles OR no period for a period of 6 months if you have a history of irregular cycles.</p>

<p>Depending on your cycle history and frequency there are different reasons why your cycle is long. It is important to tell your doctor about the frequency and regularity of your cycle to help them narrow down a cause.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="possible-reasons-for-a-long-cycle">Possible Reasons for a Long Cycle:</h2>

<p>There are so many reasons for why your cycle might be long, whether it is due to a condition, comorbid condition, or hormone imbalance. Finding the reason why your cycle is long is the most important thing to finding the best way to treat it. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some common problems that I see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Endocrine Disorder or Hormone Imbalances
    <ul>
      <li>Autoimmune Conditions</li>
      <li>PCOS</li>
      <li>Tumors</li>
      <li>Anatomical Changes</li>
      <li>Female Hormone Imbalances</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Diet
    <ul>
      <li>Irregular eating</li>
      <li>Undereating</li>
      <li>Eating disorders</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Excessive Exercise</li>
  <li>Stress</li>
  <li>Chronic Illness</li>
  <li>Medications</li>
  <li>Genetics</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<h3 id="labs">Labs:</h3>

<p>In general, I would order a comprehensive set of labs to look at what your hormones are doing and rule in or out other causes for a long cycle, for example, a thyroid condition.</p>

<p><strong>Basic –</strong> CBC, CMP, Lipids</p>

<p><strong>Hormones –</strong> Estradiol, Progesterone, Testosterone, LH, FSH, Prolactin, DHEA-S, SHBG (It is important to note that it is preferential to have hormones tested on certain days of your cycle, this can be difficult to determine if your cycle is very irregular so it is best to talk with a healthcare professional to determine what day is best for you)</p>

<p><strong>Thyroid –</strong> TSH, FT3, FT4, Thyroid Antibodies</p>

<p><strong>Pregnancy –</strong> Pregnancy Test! Believe it or not sometimes, however unlikely this is, it can happen!</p>
<h3 id="imaging">Imaging:</h3>

<p>Sometimes imaging is needed beyond lab work to help determine a cause. These are some imaging options that I consider.</p>

<p><strong>MRI of the Brain:</strong> Your brain is the controller of your hormones.  This can look for any issues that could impair how your brain is talking to the rest of your body including your female reproductive system.</p>

<p><strong>Ultrasound of the Female Reproductive Organs:</strong> This will provide a look at your uterus and ovaries to see if there are any anatomical issues for why your cycle is long. For example, in PCOS multiple cysts on your ovaries are often visualized.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="treatment">Treatment</h2>

<p>This is the hard part because treatment totally depends on the reason why! There is no one treatment that fits all. The approach to a patient who has thyroid disease is very different from the patient who has PCOS. This is why it is important to go to a doctor who will determine the root cause of your cycle irregularity!</p>

<p>When I check the box for lipids on lab work, I often get a questioning look from patients. “Why are you checking my cholesterol on a thyroid panel?” At first glance it may seem unrelated but in reality, it can be very important!</p>

<h3 id="so-why-do-i-check-lipid-levels-often-in-thyroid-patients">So, why do I check lipid levels often in thyroid patients?</h3>

<p>Your thyroid not only impacts metabolism, weight, bone health, mood, digestive function, and your menstrual cycle, but also your lipid levels – like cholesterol.</p>

<h3 id="clinically-i-have-seen-correlations-to-increased-lipids-levels-on-lab-work-when-a-patients-thyroid-function-is-suboptimal-why-is-this">Clinically, I have seen correlations to increased lipids levels on lab work when a patient’s thyroid function is suboptimal. Why is this?</h3>

<p>Your thyroid gland plays an important role in regulating cholesterol. When you are hypothyroid (your thyroid isn’t working well enough) your lipid levels, including cholesterol, often elevate.  This is because your body is not removing lipids as well as it should and bad cholesterol starts to accumulate.</p>

<p>Now, it is important to note that cholesterol in our blood stream is present in two basic forms: high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). HDL is “good cholesterol”, it helps to reduce the amount of cholesterol in the body. LDL is “bad cholesterol” and is what will start to build up if thyroid levels are not well controlled. This is what is known to clog your arteries.</p>

<h3 id="how-sluggish-does-my-thyroid-have-to-be-for-the-changes-to-occur">How sluggish does my thyroid have to be for the changes to occur?</h3>

<p>For many people, even a little dip in thyroid levels can cause major impacts on your lipids. You don’t have to be way out of the normal range! And it’s not just the Thyroid hormones you have to watch but also TSH. If your TSH is elevated but your thyroid hormones are normal, your cholesterol could elevate.</p>

<h3 id="now-why-is-this-important">Now why is this important?</h3>

<p>Well, we have all heard that cholesterol is dangerous at high levels and this is very true. Elevated cholesterol can lead to cardiovascular disease. If cholesterol is not broken down properly/ it can start to form plaques in arteries and lead to obstruction of these arteries. Now most information out there about cholesterol is related to lifestyle, which is also very important, but just one piece of the puzzle in thyroid disease. Yes, you may need to take a good look at what you are eating but for many of my patients this is not always the case. They have outstanding diets, exercise regularly but come to see me with elevated cholesterol levels. If these patients are also experiencing hypothyroid symptoms this may be an important factor to consider. All in all, if you have high cholesterol, you should be screened for hypothyroidism.</p>

<p>Many women have reached out to ask me to explain what their hormones look like if they have PCOS and this is a great follow up after looking at “normal cycles” and hormones for those on “the pill”.</p>

<p>PCOS is a hormonal disorder which is commonly diagnosed in young women. It was named for multiple cysts seen on the ovaries of patients diagnosed with PCOS, although this is a bit of a misnomer as patients with PCOS will not always have cystic ovaries.</p>

<h2 id="symptoms-of-pcos">Symptoms of PCOS</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Irregular periods or absence of your period</li>
  <li>Unusual or unwanted hair growth, for example hair growth on the chin or head hair loss</li>
  <li>Acne</li>
  <li>High blood sugar</li>
  <li>High blood pressure</li>
  <li>Weight gain or the inability to lose weight</li>
  <li>Inability to get pregnant</li>
  <li>Fatigue</li>
  <li>Sleep problems</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="hormones">Hormones</h2>

<p>Unlike the last two posts, it is much harder to provide a diagram of what hormones will look like in a cycle. This is because PCOS can present differently in various patients. Some people may have a 2-month cycle, some may not ovulate, and some may cycle regularly.</p>

<p>There are multiple female hormones that PCOS will affect like androgens, estrogen, and progesterone.</p>
<h3 id="androgens">Androgens:</h3>

<p>All females normally produce small amounts of androgens, like testosterone. In PCOS patients these androgens are usually greatly elevated.</p>

<h3 id="progesterone">Progesterone:</h3>

<p>Progesterone levels are often decreased in PCOS.</p>

<h3 id="lh-and-fsh">LH and FSH:</h3>

<p>LH and FSH are also hormones involved in a women’s menstrual cycle. In a “normal” female the ratio of LH to FSH is 1:1 (except right before ovulation) but in PCOS this ratio will often be abnormal.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-is-pcos-diagnosed">How is PCOS diagnosed?</h2>

<p>Currently, the most widely accepted way is by using something called the Rotterdam criteria:</p>

<p>Two of three are needed to make the diagnosis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Oligo – and/or anovulation – which means irregular cycles, or you are not ovulating.</li>
  <li>Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism – which means signs of high testosterone like acne or unwanted hair growth (like on the chin) OR high androgen on your labs work.</li>
  <li>Polycystic ovaries (by ultrasound) – exactly like it sounds, cysts are seen on your ovaries when imaging is performed.</li>

<p>In a previous blog post, we discussed what a “<a href="https://drtaraburke.com/what-is-a-normal-cycle/">normal cycle</a>” should look like and what your hormone levels should be. But what happens to your cycle when you are on a combination birth control pill? Today’s article will look at how the pill changes your hormones and cycle.</p>

<p>Most birth control pills contain two of the female hormones, estrogen and progesterone. These are termed combination pills. By taking the pill every day, the high levels of synthetic estrogen and progesterone make your body think that you are already pregnant.  This stops ovulation from occurring – you don’t release a viable egg and therefore it cannot be fertilized to cause a pregnancy.</p>

<p>Hormonal birth control is very effective at preventing pregnancy and for many women, this is a great option for their health goals and needs. For other women, roughly half of those who have tried hormonal birth control, it can come with many unwanted side effects like nausea, boating, breast tenderness, fatigue, sleep issues, and emotional changes. It is no surprise why many women decide to discontinue hormonal birth control due to the side effects.</p>

<p>Your blood hormone levels look vastly different when you take the pill versus when you are cycling naturally. If you need a refresher on how your hormones cycle during the course of the month, click <a href="https://drtaraburke.com/what-is-a-normal-cycle/">here</a>. The high levels of estrogen and progesterone also influence LH and FSH, which usually rise dramatically to trigger ovulation. When you are taking the pill, the high levels of synthetic progesterone and estrogen keep LH and FSH low.</p>

<p>Now if you are familiar with the pill, you will recall that a birth control pack consists of 21 hormone pills and seven placebo pills. You take 21 hormone pills in a row for three weeks, then take the seven placebo pills for one week. The placebo pills are really nothing but sugar and only function to help women keep track of how long they should take a break from the hormone containing pills. The sudden withdrawal of the hormones on this break triggers a “period”. This is not really a true period – it is actually withdrawal bleeding due to the discontinuation of the hormones and is why “periods” on the pill are usually much lighter and less painful for many women.</p>

<p>So, to answer the original question, estrogen and progestin remain at predictable high levels during days 1-21 but this is a reflection of the synthetic hormones from the pill. When you take the “sugar pills” for seven days, hormone levels plummet and you have withdrawal bleeding.</p>

<p>This is a bit of a simplification, in reality synthetic hormone levels fluctuate during the day. They peak when you take the pill and decrease over the next few hours until you have taken another pill, but on average they stay elevated.</p>

<p>The estrogen and progesterone levels are a reflection largely of the synthetic hormones in your system and not endogenous levels, the hormones you produce yourself. Usually women on the pill will have low levels of endogenous estrogen and progesterone, but that does not mean they do not experience hormonal type symptoms from the synthetic hormones.When doctors draw hormone labs while you are on the pill, it can be informative but not always useful. Labs can validate and confirm the symptoms you may be experiencing, but that is pretty predictable without labs as well.  Here is the real catch, if you are experiencing symptoms on the pill there is only so much you can do without affecting the efficacy of your birth control. It is important to remember that there are many different types of hormonal and non-hormonal birth control that work differently than the combination pill discussed above. If you are unhappy with your current birth control or are looking for a non-hormonal method make sure you talk to your doctor!</p>]]></content><author><name>Dr. Tara Burke</name></author><category term="Naturopathic Medicine" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most birth control pills contain two of the female hormones, estrogen and progesterone.

<p>I often find myself talking to my patients about abnormal cycles – whether that be the length of their period/cycle, the amount of flow, clotting, pain, etc. I thought that I would go back to some basics this week to write about what a normal cycle should look like.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics:</h2>

<p>A typical cycle comes every 25-30 days, menses is 5-7 days. As far as flow is concerned, you should not have to change more than a pad or super tampon every hour for three or more consecutive hours in one day. Initially, your blood should appear similar to a bright red in color and can then fade to a brownish color as your period ends. PMS and cramping should be minimal and you should not experience pain during your period. Even a “normal” cycle varies from person to person. The moral of the story is that a cycle should not be too long or short and should not affect your daily life. If your cycle is impacting your lifestyle then chances are you have an abnormal cycle.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="hormones">Hormones:</h2>

<p>Ok let’s talk hormones, female hormones. What are they and how do they change over the course of the month? Here’s the breakdown.</p>

<p>The main hormone players in females are Estrogen, Progesterone, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), and Testosterone. Depending where you are in your cycle, the levels are different. LH and FSH are produced in your brain and travel down to your ovaries to trigger ovulation. Estrogen Progesterone are produced in your ovaries where they function to prepare your uterus for pregnancy by producing and maintaining your uterine lining, making it a cozy environment for a fertilized egg.  How these hormones work together is easier to show visually.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="../assets/img/TheCycle.webp" alt="The Cycle" /></p>

<h2 id="the-cycle">The Cycle:</h2>

<p>Your cycle is broken down into 2 main phases – the <strong>Follicular Phase</strong>, which is from day 1 to 14, and the <strong>Luteal Phase</strong>, which is day 14-28. As you can see, your <strong>Period</strong> starts on day 1 of your cycle which is in the <strong>Follicular Phase</strong>. At the start of the follicular phase, your estrogen, progesterone, FSH, and LH levels are low. As we move into the next few days of the cycle, your <strong>Period</strong> will end, typically around day 5-6. Leading up to day 14, which is when <strong>Ovulation</strong> occurs, your estrogen levels start to increase. This is what is getting your uterus ready for <strong>ovulation</strong>. Right before Day 14, LH and FSH spike; triggering <strong>Ovulation</strong>! <strong>Ovulation</strong> is the time in a woman’s cycle that an egg is released. The <strong>Luteal Phase</strong> begins after <strong>Ovulation</strong> and is when estrogen levels rise. This function of this rise in estrogen is to prepare the uterus for pregnancy. Your progesterone levels also begin to rise dramatically and peak during day 21 of your cycle. This prepares the uterus, by building the uterine lining for implantation of the egg if it is fertilized by sperm during the magic window in your cycle. If the egg implants into the uterus, this is a pregnancy and estrogen and progesterone levels will remain high to maintain the pregnancy. If the egg is not fertilized, your levels of estrogen and progesterone decrease and the uterine lining is shed, AKA your period and the cycle begins anew!</p>]]></content><author><name>Dr. Tara Burke</name></author><category term="Naturopathic Medicine" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A typical cycle comes every 25-30 days, menses is 5-7 days.

<p>I had the pleasure of speaking to a group of mom entrepreneurs this past week about the Top Health Concerns I see in Busy Moms. For all of you that were not able to attend, I thought I would give a summary blog post of the highlights!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="thyroid-health">Thyroid Health:</h2>

<p>Your thyroid is a butterfly shaped gland that sits at the base of your neck. It is a small but mighty gland that helps with metabolism, weight, control, heart health, bone health, regulating your menstrual cycle, temperature, mood, digestive health, and your energy. Yes, it really does it all!</p>

<p>There are many different kinds and causes of thyroid conditions. Hashimoto’s, which is an autoimmune condition of the thyroid, is one of the most common conditions I see and treat in my practice.  Why? A few reasons… Hashimoto’s is more likely to happen in women than men, your risk is higher after pregnancy or after a stressful event.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Autoimmune thyroid disease is due to environmental factor but also tends to run in families.<sup id="fnref:1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Symptoms of thyroid disease are often missed or dismissed in mothers. A lot of the symptoms of thyroid disease can be blamed on a busy lifestyle, pregnancy, breastfeeding, stress etc. AKA “you are just too busy and that’s why you are tired all the time”, “hair loss is normal for new moms,” “you are working and raising kids, are you sure you are exercising enough?”, “you are just stressed”. But a lot of the time, it’s not just lifestyle to blame! Having thyroid disease and juggling work-life balance is like pushing a boulder uphill! I have to say the most common cause of fatigue in busy moms I see in my practice is a sluggish thyroid. There are many symptoms of thyroid disease so please download my <a href="../assets/handouts/Thyroid-signs-and-symptoms-1.xls">list of common symptoms</a>.</p>

<p>The stress of pregnancy, hormonal changes, and a busy life can all contribute to your thyroid health. Just checking your thyroid hormones is a simple balance to start. With my patients I start with TSH, FT3. FT4, and Thyroid antibodies. Read more about <a href="https://drtaraburke.com/thyroid-testing/">thyroid testing</a>. Imaging, like a thyroid ultrasound, can be a good idea if there is a family history of thyroid disease or a personal history of elevated antibodies. If your provider feels any sort of changes or abnormalities on an examination of your thyroid, then  imaging would also be indicated.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="adrenal-health">Adrenal Health:</h2>

<p>Your adrenal glands are located above your kidneys and help with your stress response. Cortisol is released from your adrenals and regulates your energy levels over the course of the day and night. Too little cortisol output equals fatigue and too much cortisol can cause anxiety during the day and insomnia at night.</p>

<p>Being a busy mom, or anyone that has a busy lifestyle, can worsen daily stress levels which in turn strains your adrenal glands.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/img/normal-cortisol.webp" alt="Normal Cortisol" /></p>

<p>There is a wide variety of dysfunctional patterns that all cause a variety of symptoms and thus need a different treatment approach. There is no one pill, herb, or supplement that is good for all types of adrenal dysfunction.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="female-hormone-health">Female Hormone Health:</h2>

<p>There are various types of hormone imbalances. Your environment, lifestyle, and genetics play a role on how your hormone levels change in your teens, pregnancy, and into motherhood.</p>

<p>Because of this there is no one treatment that fits all. For conditions like PCOS, endometriosis, and perimenopause, surgery and medications like the pill are not your only options, there are many natural and effective options available as well.</p>

<p>A common pattern of hormonal imbalance I see in busy moms is elevated estrogen, also known as estrogen dominance. Other patterns of hormonal imbalance include decreased levels of estrogen, elevated testosterone, and low testosterone. The most important thing is that estrogen and progesterone are balanced relative to each other and there is an appropriate amount of testosterone.</p>

<h1 id="supplements-to-balance-hormones">Supplements to Balance Hormones</h1>

<p>Hormone balance is one of the most common reasons patients pay me an initial visit, and a common question is whether I recommend supplements to balance hormones. In recent years, focus on women’s health has gone from just a yearly PAP smear and breast exam to discussion around optimal health and wellness. Women feel empowered to talk to their health care providers about topics that were previously perceived as “normal”- things like painful periods and PMS symptoms which includes cravings, mood changes, acne, and changes during perimenopause. Seeking treatment for hormone balance means that women are finally able to start the journey to optimal health and complete wellness.</p>

<p>I thought I would take some time to discuss some of my favorite herbs, nutrients, and nutrition options for hormone balance.</p>

<p>However, choosing supplements for hormone balance isn’t always cut and dry. Depending on why your hormones are imbalanced can mean that is it time for a different treatment plan.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="types-of-hormone-imbalances">Types of Hormone Imbalances</h2>

<p><strong>Elevated Estrogen Levels –</strong>  Levels can be increased due to environmental exposures, medications, poor hormone metabolism, ovarian cysts/tumors, peri-menopausal hormone changes, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT).</p>

<p>Signs and symptoms include heavy or irregular period, fibrocystic breasts, mood changes, headaches/migraines, weight gain/water retention, or acne.</p>

<p><strong>Depressed Progesterone Levels–</strong>  Progesterone Levels can be depressed due to conditions like PCOS, menopause, stress, medications, and hypothyroidism.</p>

<p>Signs and symptoms include irregular menstrual cycles, infertility, heavy or painful periods, mood changes, fatigue, poor sleep, or menopausal symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>Low Estrogen –</strong> This is very characteristic for peri and post-menopausal women. As women transition into menopause, infrequent or nonexistent periods mean decreasing estrogen levels. For some women this transition is mild while for others it is very severe and debilitating.</p>

<p>Signs and symptoms include hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, joint and muscle pain, brain fog, bone loss, and low sex drive.</p>

<p><strong>Elevated Progesterone –</strong> While not as common as estrogen dominance, this hormonal imbalance is still possible. Elevated Progesterone most often results from inappropriately dosed hormone replacement therapy. It can also occur with certain congenital disorders, ovarian cysts, and tumors.</p>

<p>Symptoms of progesterone dominance are very sensitive to the cause but can include, bloating, sleepiness and grogginess, and mood changes.</p>

<p><strong>Elevated Testosterone –</strong> This is commonly seen in disorders like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), hirsutism, inappropriate dosed hormone replacement therapy, or less common congenital syndromes.</p>

<p>Signs of Elevated Testosterone include acne, unwanted/inappropriate hair growth on places such as your chin, irregular periods, and feeling “more aggressive/irritated”.</p>

<p><strong>Low Testosterone –</strong> Low <a href="https://www.hormone.org/your-health-and-hormones/glands-and-hormones-a-to-z/hormones/testosterone">Testosterone</a> is also seen commonly in the peri and post-menopause stages and is unfortunately a common part of ageing. I am also seeing it more frequently in younger females and can be an indicator of issues in the ovaries or adrenal glands.</p>

<p>Signs of Low Testosterone include low libido, fatigue, weakness, and depressed mood.</p>

<p><strong>Other hormone imbalances –</strong> Thyroid and adrenal health can be impacted by changes in female hormone health. Conversely, female hormone health can be impacted by disorders of thyroid and adrenal glands. The best way to determine diagnosis and treatment is to see your health care provider that is trained in hormone imbalances.</p>

<h2 id="herbs-nutrients-and-nutrition-options-for-hormone-balance">Herbs, Nutrients, and Nutrition Options for Hormone Balance</h2>

<p>As a Naturopathic Doctor, I am lucky to have so many “tools in my toolbox” to provide treatment options to my patients having hormonal balance issues! Depending on symptom severity and patient preference, I can choose between a variety of options that will work best for them. This is one of the many reasons that I love Naturopathic Medicine and one of the reasons I often use supplements to balance hormones.</p>

<h3 id="herbal-and-alternative-medicine">Herbal and Alternative Medicine:</h3>

<p>I love using herbal formulations with my patients in order to provide safe and effective relief for their symptoms. Herbals are a gentle way to treat for many symptoms such as hot flashes, painful periods, unpredictable periods, hormonal acne, fertility, sleep, and more! Here are some common herbal supplements to balance hormones and combat these unwanted issues</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Black Cohosh (Cimicifuga or Actaea racemose):</em></strong> This herb is very famous for its use in menopause, especially for hot flashes. There have been mixed results from research studies on the efficacy of this herb but clinically it has been effective for many patients. I personally find it to be a good option when used in conjunction with other herbals in a formula for menopause. Overshadowed by its attention for menopause relief, this herb is also great for PMS, period cramping, and irregular periods. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong><em>Chaste Tree (Vitex annus):</em></strong> Used traditionally for many years, Chaste Tree Berry is a very famous herb in the realm of hormone balance! It works on the pituitary gland to increase the luteinizing hormone (LH), stimulating ovulation and increasing progesterone.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> It is often used to provide relief from PMS and PMDD symptoms. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong><em>Kava (Piper methysticum):</em></strong> This is a personal favorite herb of mine! Why? Because it does so much, it is one of the best herbal supplements to balance hormones! It is noted for its calming but non-sedative effects<sup id="fnref:2:1"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and efficacy for menopausal symptoms. It also effective at alleviating painful periods due to its muscle relaxant properties.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Maca (Lepidium Peruvianum):</em></strong> This is another personal favorite of mine. It is wonderful for women in all stages of life – from helping regulate cycles in young women to relieving menopausal symptoms. <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong><em>Fenugreek:</em></strong> This herb is most widely known for its use to encourage milk production in breastfeeding mothers. One of its lesser known abilities is to help women with low testosterone level and improving libido. Although the research is still out on whether it results in a direct increase to testosterone, it consistently seems to have a positive effect on the libido. It is also indicated for helping with insulin sensitivity, which is a common use case in patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). <sup id="fnref:2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong><em>Licorice and Saw palmetto:</em></strong> These herbs are a great choice for those looking to lower testosterone levels such as in patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). <sup id="fnref:2:3"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong><em>Inositol:</em></strong> Often used in thyroid and PCOS patients, there is tremendously encouraging research for effectiveness for these conditions when dosed appropriately.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, there are so many wonderful herbal supplements to balance hormones that I cannot possibly mention them all. It is also important to know that there is more to herbs that simply checking what health issues they are indicated for. They also have synergistic properties, which means that some herbs work better together! A naturopathic doctor can come up with a herbal formula that is dosed safely and appropriately for your individualized health history and concerns. There are also pre-made supplements on the market which are formulated for hormone balance. My trustworthy brands in this category include Vitanica and Femenessence.</p>

<h3 id="nutrition">Nutrition:</h3>

<p>Often times we can’t rely solely on herbal supplements to balance hormones, and thus we must combine it with another method. One of my favorite ways to compliment herbal therapies is with dietary recommendations.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Veggies:</em></strong> Vegetables are a wonderful way to help encourage great hormonal health. Many are high in fiber which can help insulin sensitivity and digestion. Cruciferous vegetables deserve a special mention as they can help metabolize estrogens better as contains Indole-3-carbinol (I3C). 2 Vegetables in general can help enhance liver function which is important because estrogen metabolites can build up if your liver isn’t working optimally.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Flax seed:</em></strong> Known as a superfood, Flax Seed is also a wonderful addition to your diet to help with hormone imbalance, as it acts as a phytoestrogen. <sup id="fnref:2:4"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> What is a phytoestrogen? It is a component that acts like estrogen in the body. This mean it can help with high or low estrogen levels. How? Because it works in the body on estrogen receptors, allowing it to regulate hormone levels appropriately, becoming weakly estrogenic or antiestrogenic. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> In this way it can help regulate menstrual cycles and is great for elevated or depressed estrogen levels. It can also help to bind up extra androgens, like testosterone if levels are too high (like in PCOS), and is great source of fiber. Using phytoestrogens are not for everyone depending on diagnoses, medical history, or medications.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Spearmint Tea:</em></strong> This is wonderful for patients who are having health issues like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), who are looking to help decrease testosterone.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Avoiding Sugar and Caffeine:</em></strong> When estrogen levels are elevated, caffeine and sugar can worsen symptoms. Thus, it is important to avoid drinks that contain these elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether a diet plan based around these changes is appropriate for you can be best determined by your health care provider.</p>

<h3 id="bioidentical-hormone-replacement-therapy-bhrt">Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT):</h3>

<p>For my women who have more severe symptoms supplements to balance hormones may not be enough and in this case Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT) can be a great option. With proper labs, follow-up, and customized dosing, this can be a safe step up in a patient’s therapy from more natural options. Remember, it’s all about safety first, so using the lowest level of therapy to provide adequate symptom relief is ideal!</p>

<p>There is no one herb, nutritional plan, product, or therapy that is good for everything hormones related. It is vital to determine what type of hormone imbalance you have and why. Finding the root cause to your health issues can bring you back to long-lasting optimal health – herbals, nutrition, and medications can help you there. A qualified health care professional can offer testing, interpretation, diagnosis, and treatment for your unique needs and goals!</p>

<h3 id="so-what-can-you-do-now">So, what can you do now?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>If you have your period: Start tracking your menstrual cycle with all symptoms.</li>
  <li>“Clean Up” your environment – be mindful of what is in your personal care products, stop microwaving and storing foods in plastic, switch to a glass or metal water bottle, and avoid processed foods.</li>
  <li>Make an appointment with a skilled practitioner who is familiar with hormonal imbalance, like a naturopathic doctor.</li>
  <li>Get your hormone labs completed and read by your naturopathic doctor or licensed functional medicine practitioner.</li>
  <li>Take a look at your diet – make a diet diary of all the foods you are having for a week and bring it into your naturopathic doctor so they can help to tell you what foods are helping or hindering your hormones.</li>
</ol>

<p>Make an appointment with a doctor who can help to determine what medications or supplements to balance hormones are appropriate for your type of hormone imbalance.</p>

<h1 id="herbs-for-hypothyroid">Herbs for Hypothyroid</h1>

<hr />

<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>

<p>There are a number of benefits, drawbacks, and common misconceptions when it comes treatment using herbs for hypothyroid, so let’s lay out the facts on some of the most common ones. Firstly, hypothyroidism is a condition where your thyroid is not making enough thyroid hormone. There are various causes of hypothyroid like autoimmune conditions, diet, medications, environmental exposures, and surgical removal of the thyroid. Here are a few herbals that have been traditionally used for hypothyroidism. If you think maybe you need a refresher on how your thyroid talks to the rest of your body, go ahead and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo3oTNJ0DT0">this quick video</a> first!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-most-commonly-prescribed-herb-for-hypothyroid">The Most Commonly Prescribed Herb for Hypothyroid:</h2>

<p>Fucus vesiculosus, alternatively known as <a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-726/bladderwrack">Bladderwrack</a>, is the herb most commonly associated with the treatment of hypothyroid. This is a kelp and seaweed product that is often used in hypothyroidism due to the high iodine content. Insufficient levels of iodine can cause hypothyroidism – BUT taking additional iodine from Bladderwrack can more often than not be detrimental to your thyroid.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Why? Iodine has a very narrow therapeutic index, meaning it has a very narrow window between an effective dose and one which produces adverse effects. Put simply, too much, or too little iodine can be harmful.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> In a standard American diet most people already get plenty of iodine, meaning additional sources in supplemental or herbal form can do more harm than good. Please consult with a knowledgeable practitioner before you start taking Bladderwrack to determine if it is actually indicated in your case.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>THE BOTTOM LINE:</em></strong> More often than not, Bladderwrack will actually provide TOO MUCH iodine and be detrimental to your system.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="other-commonly-prescribed-herbs-for-hypothyroid">Other Commonly Prescribed Herbs for Hypothyroid:</h2>

<p>Centella asiatica, or <a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-753/gotu-kola">Gotu kola</a>, is a great adaptogenic herb that supports brain health, nerves, and mood.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> It is considered one of the safer adaptogenic herbs and is generally well tolerated by patients. One of the most common subjective symptoms that hypothyroid patients  report is “brain fog”. Centella in herbal formula can help support cognitive function. However, on its own, this herbal is not sufficient to treat hypothyroidism.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>THE BOTTOM LINE:</em></strong> This herb can help with the “brain fog” feeling you may have from hypothyroidism, but has not yet been shown by research to improve thyroid lab markers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ganoderma lucidum, a <a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-905/reishi-mushroom">mushroom</a>, is an adaptogenic herb that is commonly seen in hypothyroid formulas. It improves cardiovascular health, helping reduce cholesterol which is commonly elevated in poorly controlled hypothyroidism.<sup id="fnref:3:1"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Once again though, this herb has not been shown to improve thyroid function through research.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>THE BOTTOM LINE:</em></strong> This fungal herb can improve cardiovascular health and reduce cholesterol,  but has also not yet been shown by research to improve thyroid lab markers.</li>

<p>Cordyceps sinensis, a <a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-602/cordyceps">fungus</a>, is also often found in hypothyroid formulas. It is a wonderful adaptogenic herbal choice for patients that are extremely fatigued. With the additional bonus that it can help with insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular health. However, once again, this herb has not been shown to improve thyroid function directly.</p>

<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, better known as <a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-881/licorice">licorice</a>, is an all-around great herb. While not specifically for thyroid health, it is indicated for improving cortisol levels. Often, when the thyroid is stressed it can impact other endocrine systems like the adrenal glands, which produce cortisol. If you are feeling persistent fatigue after hypothyroid treatment, this can be due to struggling adrenals. Similarly to Centella, licorice may have some cognitive enhancing effects.<sup id="fnref:3:2"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>THE BOTTOM LINE:</em></strong> Licorice is an incredible herb that can help with improving cortisol levels and reducing fatigue, but has also not yet been shown by research to directly treat hypothyroidism.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nigella Sativa, or <a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-901/black-seed">black cumin</a>, is used in autoimmune conditions like Hashimotos. It can help decrease elevated antibody levels seen on labs. It has also been reported to help decrease TSH levels and raise T3 levels, in addition to helping to reduce weight gain often seen in hypothyroid patients.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Unlike the previous herbs, this is generally prescribed in a capsule instead of as a tincture.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>THE BOTTOM LINE:</em></strong> Black cumin is an excellent herb for autoimmune hypothyroid conditions that helps with inflammation, weight gain, and TSH/T3 levels from labs. Black cumin is a great start to helping your hypothyroid condition, but is likely not enough on it’s own.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Remember that just because something is natural does not necessarily make it safe! Many herbals can have serious side effects, adverse reactions, interactions with other medications/supplements/herbs and may not be OK to take during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. ALWAYS ask your doctor before starting anything new.</strong></p>

<h2 id="but-this-is-not-the-end-of-the-story">But this is not the end of the story….</h2>

<p>While all of these herbs have traditionally been used in hypothyroid, they are typically not enough. Serious long-term effects can result from attempting to treat your hypothyroid condition with herbals alone. Negative effects from not properly treating hypoythroid conditions include elevations in cholesterol and lipids, <sup id="fnref:3:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  decreased fertility,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  and  poor gastrointestinal health. Elevations in TSH can promote unwanted growth of the thyroid gland which is exceedingly important to take into consideration for patients with a history of nodules or thyroid cancer.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Regular thyroid labs and imaging completed by your healthcare professional are important for the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism. For more info on how to test your thyroid please check out this article about <a href="https://drtaraburke.com/thyroid-testing/">which labs should be run</a>.</p>

<p>It is also critical to find the root cause of your hypothyroid before starting any natural options. Depending on the cause of your sluggish thyroid, herbal products may not be indicated and could cause more harm. Talking with your doctor before starting natural options is important.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="so-if-herbals-are-not-enough-on-their-own-what-are-my-other-options">So, if herbals are not enough on their own what are my other options?</h2>

<p>Well this is when medications are indicated and imperative. There are various medication options to treat hypothyroidism, both synthetic and natural. Talking with your doctor to find the right type and dose of medication can help you feel better as well as mitigate complications from untreated hypothyroidism.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Traditionally used herbs for hypothyroid are not sufficient to treat hypothyroidism on their own. They are a great option to be used in conjunction with medications and dietary changes. It can help make you feel better by relieving symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, and stress, and in addition decrease elevated thyroid antibodies seen in autoimmune hypothyroid conditions. Before deciding on a treatment option or change to your treatment plan, please speak to your doctor.</p>

<p>Naturopathic doctors have the knowledge to customize herbal supplements that are tailored to your unique health concerns and can safely be used with many medications. Naturopathic doctors also can help with choosing a thyroid medication that fits your unique goals and situation.</p>

<p>If you have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism or Hashimotos, or think you may have hypothyroid I am here to answer questions and help get you back to feeling well again.</p>

<p>Avoiding plastics is not only good for the environment, but also good for your health! While I realize one person avoiding single use plastic products won’t save the world, I am a firm believer that every little bit helps. Making these small changes in our home has become especially important because of Lil B – we want to leave this plant a better place for him!</p>

<p>In addition to the environmental aspects of plastic, plastics are also associated with a host of health issues. I tried to avoid all plastics in Lil B’s first year of life and continue to limit them now.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="here-are-some-tips">Here are some Tips:</h2>

<h3 id="breastmilk-and-formula">Breastmilk and Formula:</h3>

<p>Breastfeeding helped to avoid bottles for the most part, but when I went back to work I needed to store and pack breastmilk.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use glass bottles, we loved ours from lifefactory and he hasn’t managed to break one yet!</li>
  <li>Consider using glass to store breast milk in the fridge and freezer, eventually I didn’t have enough room and choose to use BPA free store bags.</li>
  <li>When your baby is old enough for water and non-breast milks try a metal container, they are hard to break and their beverage won’t be sitting in plastic</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="food">Food:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Make your own baby food and store it in reusable glass containers (bonus for budget, environment, and your baby’s health)</li>
  <li>If you don’t want to make your own food, try to find baby food stored in glass</li>
  <li>NEVER heat plastic in the microwave, use glass containers</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toys">Toys:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I tried to avoid toys made of plastic, everything goes into their mouths. He loved his toys made of wood, silicone, and natural materials</li>
  <li>Babies grow quickly and outgrow toys – I made an effort to choose toys that wouldn’t leave an environmental impact.</li>
  <li>Consider buying second hand or getting hammy-downs as they get older and plastic toys are hard to avoid! We also had friends give us an exersaucer and swing, and our parents kept some of our own past favourite toys.</li>
  <li>Lil B is more than happy to play with my pots and pans, cardboard boxes, spoons, etc. and there are so many clever ideas on Pinterest for using things you already have around the house.</li>
  <li>Go outside – Lil B is enthralled with sticks, rocks, and leaves. We poke, pile, and sort them together. He learns new skills and about the wonderful world around him!</li>
