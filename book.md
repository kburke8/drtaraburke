### Important Clinic Information - Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
Due to COVID-19 Dr. Burke has limited availability for in-person clinic visits. This allows us to appropriately space clinic visits to ensure sanitation and limit overlap of patients in the waiting room. Our top priority is keeping our patients and families safe! Dr. Burke will be taking extra steps and precautions for in-person visits. All patients are required to wear a mask/face-covering.

For your peace of mind, please know that Dr. Burke has been fully vaccinated for COVID-19.

We will continue to keep you apprised with clinic updates should the situation change. We greatly appreciate all of your support, cooperation, and understanding in our efforts to keep the community healthy.
