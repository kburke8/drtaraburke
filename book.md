When scheduling your next visit, be aware that all patients requiring a refill on a prescription pharmaceutical medication, including hormone replacement therapy, will require an <b>in-person</b> visit.

Being present in person allows us to accurately measure vital signs and conduct a comprehensive health assessment. This is particularly important for patients taking prescription medications, as it helps us confirm the ongoing suitability and safety of treatment.

Additionally, please note that temporary provisions and protections that enabled increased access to telemedicine during the COVID pandemic have now been lifted. As a result, we may now require in-person visits to ensure the highest quality of care and comprehensive assessment for our patients. This transition reflects our commitment to maintaining the standards of safety, accuracy, and personalized healthcare that are best achieved through face-to-face consultations.
