We’re excited to let you know that we are transitioning to a new patient portal and records system — **Practice Better** — to enhance your care experience.

This new platform offers:

- A more user-friendly experience
- Streamlined access to protocols and visit summaries
- Easier appointment scheduling
- Integrated video calls and secure messaging
- Better organization for your health goals and action plans

Starting July 1, 2025, we will no longer use ChARm for new appointments, messaging, or document sharing. If you’ve had a visit within the last 6 months, you’ll receive an email invitation soon to activate your new **Practice Better** account. If it’s been longer, you’ll be granted access when you schedule your next visit. If you’d like to get set up sooner, just let us know—we’re happy to help!

Here's what you need to know:

- You will receive an email with an invitation link to create your account when you book your next appointment.
- If you have an upcoming appointment, we’ll ensure everything is transferred and easy to access.
- Old records will remain secure and accessible, and we can send you copies as needed.
- You can still message us through Charm until July 1st, 2025.

We’re here to make the transition smooth and simple. If you need help activating your new account or have any questions, just reach out — we’re happy to assist!

Dr. Burke and Taylor
