  - question: Are in-person visits required?
    answer: |
      <p>All new patients will require an in-person visit.</p>
      <p>Additionally, patients are required to be seen in person at least once per year.</p>
      <p>Being present in person allows us to accurately measure vital signs and conduct a comprehensive health assessment, and helps us confirm the ongoing suitability and safety of treatment.</p>
  - question: Do you accept insurance?
    answer: |
      <p>At this time we do not contract with insurance. We are better able to provide the services patients require with shorter wait times and longer, more meaningful visits.  </p>
      <p>While we are not “in-network” with any insurance plans, you may be able to receive reimbursement directly from the insurance company. In addition, many patients choose to use HSA (Health Savings Account) cards to pay for their appointments.  Please check with your insurance company in order to determine what they require. Many insurance companies will also cover much of the lab work our provider may order.</p>
      <p> Dr. Burke works with every budget to provide optimal care to her patients.<p>
  - question: What conditions do you treat?
    answer: |
      <p>Dr. Burke is well versed in a variety of health conditions and concerns. However, her practice focuses in Thyroid, Adrenal, Hormonal Balancing, Women's Medicine, and Digestive Health. Please see the <a href='https://drtaraburke.com/#services'>services page</a> for additional information.</p>
      <p>If your specific condition is not listed but you're still interested in consulting with Dr. Burke, please arrange a discovery call with her. This call will help determine whether your concern aligns well with her expertise. Please note that Dr. Burke does not provide primary care services such as Well Women’s exams, PAPs, or Acute Care.</p>
  - question: How many visits are required?
    answer: |
      <p>Dr. Burke focuses on finding the root cause of your illness or imbalance, which is what makes the naturopathic approach to medicine so unique.</p>
      <p>Giving a generalized time frame is difficult as each patient and condition is different. As a general rule, you may start to feel some improvements after your first visit, but you should expect a few visits to see significant changes. Remember, for many chronic conditions, you didn’t start feeling poorly overnight - it likely took days, months, or even years.</p>
